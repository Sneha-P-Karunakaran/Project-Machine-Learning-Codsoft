# Project-Machine-Learning-Codsoft
 Bank Customer Churn prediction (Codsoft-Internship)

## Overview

This project, part of my Codsoft internship, focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave, helping the bank to improve retention strategies.

## Data

The dataset includes features such as:
- Customer ID
- Account Balance
- Number of Transactions
- Customer Age
- Account Type
- Churn Label (1 for churned, 0 for not)

## Approach

1. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data.
2. **Analysis**: Explored and visualized data to uncover patterns.
3. **Modeling**: Applied machine learning models to predict churn.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## Tools and Skills

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**: Data Cleaning, Machine Learning

## Results

The model provides insights into customer churn, helping to target retention efforts effectively.
